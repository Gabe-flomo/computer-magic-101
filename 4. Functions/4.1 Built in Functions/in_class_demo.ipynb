        "# What are functions\n",
        "In programming, a function can be thought of as a *`reusable block of code`*. For example, say we're working on a project where we will need to find the maximum value of a list many times throughout our program. Without the use of functions, we would have to write the code to perform this task each time the task is needed to be performed, which is highly inefficient. With functions, we can create a kind of mapping from a set of inputs to generate the desired output. In this example, our input would be a list of numbers and out output would be the maximum value in that list.\n",
