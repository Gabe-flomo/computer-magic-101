    "## Counting decimal numbers vs. Binary numbers\n",
    "A decimal number is a number represented in base 10, meaning that you have 10 whole numbers (0-9) to count with until you need to start reusing the same numbers to count to higher values. A binary number is a number represented in base 2, meaning that you have 2 whole numbers (0 and 1) to count with until you need to reuse the same numbers to count to higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decimal: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` -> `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19`\n",
    "* Binary: `0, 1` -> `10 (2), 11 (3)` -> `100 (4), 101 (5), 110 (6), 111 (7)` -> `1000 (8), 1001 (9), 1010 (10), 1011 (11), 1100 (12) ...`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decimal places and binary places\n",
    "To represent any value in base 10 (decimal), numbers have place values likes `ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands` to represent a total value. Since were in base 10, the place values go up by a factor of 10 each time. So if said `\"There are 9 thousands, 2 hundreds, 4 tens, and 3 ones\"` this is equivalent to saying `\"The number is 9,243\"`.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, binary place values are `ones, twos, fours, eights, and so on`. Because binary only works with 2 values (0, 1) you can think of each binary number as being a set of switches that represent `on or off`. So if I said `\"The ones place is on, twos is off, and fours is on\"` this is equivalent to saying `\"101\"` which is equal to `5`.\n",

    "***Notice how in both of the visuals above, each 'place' is represented by the base system you're using raised to the exponent of `n`, where `n` starts at zero and increases by one (from right to left)***\n",

    "## Converting from binary to decimal\n",
    "Each place in a binary number is occupied by a binary digit, or *`bit`* for short. Each of these `bits` can be on (1) or off (0). If we put 8 of these `bits` in a sequence to represent a single value we have an 8-bit number, which is also called a `byte`. If you were to generate 1024 8-bit numbers or 1024 `bytes`, you can represent 1 kilobyte worth of information. Consider the 8-bit value `00101110`, we can convert this number to decimal by taking the sum of all the positions where the `bit` is equal to 1. \n",
