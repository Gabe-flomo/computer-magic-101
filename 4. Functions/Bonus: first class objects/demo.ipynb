    "# First class objects\n",
    "In python, everything is an object including functions. This means that they may be stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or used in control structures.\n",
    "In this short lesson I will show you how you can treat functions as first class objects.\n",

    "## Functions as variables\n",
    "When defining a function, you are creating a template for how certain inputs (arguments) should be processed in order to produce an output. When it's time to use your function, you have to 'trigger' it by calling it. Given you provided the correct inputs, it will give you some output. However, you can create copies of your functions by assigning them to variables without calling them.\n",

    "```python \n",
    "def scream(text):\n",
    "    return text.upper()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(scream(\"wassup\")) -> \"WASSUP\"\n",
    "\n",
    "shout = scream\n",
    "print(shout(\"whats good\")) -> \"WHATS GOOD\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In all honesty though, this the a useless way to pass functions around, so lets look at more practical use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions as arguments\n",
    "In the same way that you can pass integers, string, lists, or any other data type as an argument to a function, you can also pass other functions as arguments. This is how builtin functions like `filter` or `map` are able to work, because they expect a function as one of their arguments. All you need to do in order to pass a function as an argument is to just pass the name of the function.\n",

    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    return \"Hello\"\n",

    "def give_me_func(function):\n",
    "    return function()\n",

    "print(give_me_func(say_hello)) -> \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(give_me_func(say_goodbye)) -> \"goodbye\"\n",

    "## Functions inside of other data structures\n",
    "Lets say you're working on a project where you ask the user to input some text and you want to perform different operations depending on the text that they entered. One way you can achieve this is by having `if/else` statements that execute depending on what the user inputs. However, if you have lots of options, your code may get long and unreadable. One way to overcome this issue is to nest your functions inside of other data structures, for example, a dictionary.\n",
