    "In programmming, the concept of recursion is an object that calls itself. In most cases this object is a function but there are also cases of classes using recursion to create data structures like linked lists. You can think of recursion as putting two mirrors in front of eachother so that any object that you put between them will be seen recursively in the mirrors. \n",

    "Recursion works because of 2 operations working together, a `stop condition` and a `recursive call`. The `recursive call` is just where the function calls itself inside of itself. The recursive call doesn't actually execute anything new, it just calls the same function with new inputs. The `stop condition` is any condition that does not result in another recursive call. In theory, anything that you can do in a loop, you can also convert it into a recursive function.\n",

So if I want to find the factorial of 5 (5!), I would multiply `5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1` which will result in the number 120. Since the calculation is just multiply `n` by `n - 1` we can implement this logic recursively. \n",
