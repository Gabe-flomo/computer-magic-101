    "# What is an exception and how do they occur\n",
    "An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of exceptions\n",
    "There are many types of object that represent exceptions, however there are only 2 categories of exceptions that you can encounter. Syntactical errors and Logical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax errors\n",
    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are the most common kind of complaint you will get while still learning Python. These are errors caused by writing instructions that do not follow the proper structure of the language. You can think of a syntax error as writing code that simply doesn't make any sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:** `Walked stairs the Gabe down` makes 0 sense and it is because it is full of syntax errors. This sentence doesn't follow any of the rules or structure of the english language, making it hard to understand what it is trying to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax error examples in python\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# starting a for loop without a colon\n",
    "for i in range(10)\n",
    "print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# just no\n",
    "print() name\n",
    "\n",
    "# what?\n",
    "while for i in range(i):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Errors\n",
    "Errors that occur at runtime (While the program is running) are called exceptions or logical errors. For instance, they may occur when we trying to read a file that does not exist (FileNotFoundError), trying to divide a number by zero (ZeroDivisionError), or trying to import a module that does not exist (ImportError).\n",
    "Whenever these types of runtime errors occur, Python creates an exception object. If not handled properly, it prints a traceback to that error along with some details about why that error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical errors in python\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import NonExistentModule -> ImportError\n",

Usually when writing code to catch exceptions, you won't know when or where the exception will occur until it has happened and once it has happened, you can see which exception has been thrown and handle each exception appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:** Consider the following list `[1, 2, '3', 4, 0]`. Say we want to loop through this list and divide 2 from every element. Because some of the elements aren't a numeric data type we will run into `TypeErrors`. Also some of the elements are equal to 0 so we will also get `ZeroDivision` errors. We can catch each of these errors individually and do different things depending on which error occurs.\n",
