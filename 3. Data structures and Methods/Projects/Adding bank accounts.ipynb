        "- Create a dictionary with only one key called `checkings` with a default value of `$50`\n",
        "- Allow the users to withdraw and deposit money into their `checkings` account \n",
        "- Let the users create new accounts with default values of `$0`\n",
        "- before the user makes a transaction they need to specify which account they're making the transaction in.\n",

        "* `withdraw` - remove money from account\n",
        "* `deposit` - add money to account\n",
