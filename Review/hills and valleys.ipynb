    "An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly ***x*** steps, for every step it was noted ***U*** if it was an uphill, or a ***D*** if it was downhill step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a ***1*** unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:\n",

    "* A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.\n",
    "* A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.\n",
