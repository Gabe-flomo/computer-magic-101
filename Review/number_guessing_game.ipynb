    "In this challenge, it's you against the computer. The computer will generate a number between 1 and 100 and you have 6 attempts to guess what the number is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations\n",
    "- after each guess, print out the value of the guess\n",
    "- **For high guesses**\n",
    "    - if the guess is more than 20 numbers off, print `guess is too high`\n",
    "    - if the guess is equal to or less than 10 numbers off, print `just a little lower`\n",
    "    - otherwise print, `close, but your guess is high`\n",
    "- **For low guesses**\n",
    "    - if the guess is more than 20 numbers off, print `guess is too low`\n",
    "    - if the guess is equal to or less than 10 numbers off, print `just a little higher`\n",
    "    - otherwise print, `close, but your guess is low`\n",
    "- If the user can guess the number within the allowed number of attempts, print that they won and how many attepmts they had left\n",
    "- If the user loses, print that they lost along with what the number was.\n",
